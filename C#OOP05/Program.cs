        /*  a) What happens when you assign one object variable to another object variable?
         *     Answer: When you assign one object variable to another, you copy the reference of the object, not the actual object itself.
         *     
         *  b) Does assigning one object to another create a new object? Explain
         *     Answer: No, assigning one object to another does not create a new object. It simply copies the reference of the same object in memory. 
         *             Both variables will point to the same instance, and any modifications made through one reference the other will be affect.
         *  
         *  c) What is the difference between copying an object and copying its reference?
         *     Answer: Copying an object creates a new instance of the object with the same values, means two objects are independent of each other. Any changes made to one object does't affect to the other. 
         *             On the other hand, copying its reference means that both variables point to the same object in memory, and changes made through one variable will affect the other since they refer to the same instance.

        #region Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy
        /*  a) What is a Shallow Copy?
         *     Answer: A shallow copy creates a new object, and copies all value type fields, and reference type fields are copied as references not copies the objects they point to.
         * 
         *  b) What is a Deep Copy?
         *     Answer: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects. This means that the deep copy and the original object are completely independent of each other.
         *
         *  c) What happens to reference-type members when a Shallow Copy is created?
         *     Answer: When a shallow copy is created, reference-type members are copied as references,
         *             This means that both the original object and the shallow copy will point to the same instance of the reference-type member.
         *             
         *  d) What happens to reference-type members when a Deep Copy is created?
         *     Answer: When a deep copy is created, reference-type members are recursively copied, creating new instances of the objects they point to. 
         *             This means that the deep copy and the original object are completely independent of each other.
         *             
         *  e) Give one situation where Deep Copy would be safer than Shallow Copy.
         *     Answer: when the object contains reference-type, if you want to modify the copied object, 
         *             A deep copy would be safer because when you want to modify in the copied object, the original object will not be affected, because they are independent of each other, 
         *             On the other hand, if you use a shallow copy, any changes made to the reference-type members in the copied object will also affect the original object, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs, because both objects share the same reference to the same instance of the reference-type member.
